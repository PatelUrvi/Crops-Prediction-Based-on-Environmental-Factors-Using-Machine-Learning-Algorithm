The publication discusses the importance of agriculture in India and the impact of technology on crop production. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine are applied to anticipate crop yield based on environmental factors such as soil conditions, temperature, and rainfall. By analyzing data patterns, these algorithms provide accurate predictions of crops suitable for a particular area. The accuracy of the models is compared using such factors like precision, recall, F1 score, and support. The results help farmers make informed decisions about planting crops based on soil and climatic conditions, leading to smart agricultural production.
